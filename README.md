# C-Webserver WIP
This is a simple static webserver written in C

## Description

This is a simple static webserver written in C, using standard libraries, making it so you're able to perform almost all HTTP 1.1 requests (POST, PUT, GET, TRACE, OPTIONS, DELETE).

## Getting Started
### Dependencies
If you have the GNU compiler, you won't need to install any other libraries
This is specifically a windows webserver, this won't work on linux and/or mac.
### Executing the program
Once you compile the project and get the "server.exe" file, you'll only need to use the command "start server.exe"
